# LIS Dataset Directory

This directory contains the Low-Light Instance Segmentation (LIS) dataset.
Data is external and should be organized as follows:

structure:
- `images/`: Contains RGB low-light images.
- `annotations/`: Contains COCO-style JSON annotation files.

Do not commit large image files to the repository.
